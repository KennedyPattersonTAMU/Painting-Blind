  <h3 align="center"> Assignment 3: Painting Blind </h3>

  <p align="center">
    This project is a series of digital paintings exploring the ways in which color blindness can change the artistic method. Through the use of colorblind filters and digital software I created realistic portraits of copyright free photographs by trying to match the colors I saw with a colorblind filter on and the colors on an RGB digital colorwheel.

*Figure 1. 4 digital paintings that I created utilizing filters simulating 2 different types of color blindness, Deuteranopia and Monochromia. The first 2 images (top left and right) feature digital paintings of a light skinned woman with dark hair and pearl earrings. The top left utilizes a Deuteranopia filter and the right is the same image in full color. The last 2 images (bottom left and right) feature digital paintings of a dark skinned woman with striking blue makup and hooped earrings. The bottom left utilizes a greyscale filter and the right is the same image in full color. Both original images are taken from pexels.com and are utilized under a creative commons license.*

## Abstract
This project is an exploration of how different types of color blindness can effect the color choices an artist uses when attempting to accurately recreate a painting. I test the ways in which the color picking process changes when faced with the challenge of attempting to recreate realism with an added disability and the beautiful unintended results that can follow.

One of the largest ethical issues plaguing the new AI industry is the means by which many models acquired their training data [4]. The data is often scrapped from numerous sources across the internet without credit and used to train AI Image generation models. Those models then will often regurgitate those same stolen images in their outputs, sometimes without the user even knowing the generated image could be plagiarized and placing both the AI companies and their users at legal risk [2].

There have been recent efforts to make the generation methods of machine learning models more transparent through techniques such as Explainable AI (XAI) which could be a step towards solving these ethical issues [3]. But these efforts are likely to be ignored by large tech companies due to the effort and cost associated with ethically retraining such large models.

The greed inherent in decisions such as these, shirking ethics in lieu of profit and disregarding laws that  protect artists, inspired my yonkoma. The panels follow the growth of an artist from youth to the peak of their career. Their steady growth is abruptly halted in the 3rd cell as they are captured, and all the creativity is wrung out of them in the form of plagiarized AI images. 


## Methodology
[![4-comma][images-fig5]](https://example.com)

*Figure 3. A series of images showing the process of creating the Monochromia filter painting. The first row features the images in full color going from the initial block in stage, the smoothing stage, and finally the restructuring phase. The second row features the images with a Greyscale filter following the same previous 3 stages.*

I started this process by downloading the ColourSimulations app for windows as it allowed me to both simulate the sensation of color blindness on my screen without correcting the image through Daltonization [3] as well as interface with my computer normally (most other filter software is temporary and only shows a snapshot of a design in CB mode before reverting back to normal). I set the filter at 100% severity for both filters in order to both account for the most severly impacted people with color blindness and to give the most unique possible image. 

[![4-comma][images-fig4]](https://example.com)

*Figure 4. The first image is a screen capture of the ColourSimulations page on the Microsoft store. The second image is an example of the ColourSimulations software being used on the Deuteranopia painting with part of the face in full color and part of the face changed by the filter.*


I then proceeded to attempt to recreate the source image as accurately as I could with the added handicap of the CB filter on. I started by sectioning the painting into smaller shapes and using the color picker to attempt to accurately simulate the hue, value, and saturation that I was seeing in the same section of the source image. The added difficulty of the CB handicap made this first pass much slower than I was used to as there were many more equivalent color choices to choose from. 

Once the painting was sectioned off into discrete color blocks I used a smoothing brush to obscure the section edges and add a smooth finish to the painting. Finally, I added a final restructuring layer that re-introduced areas of detail that were obscured by the smoothing pass.

I repeated this process for 2 different types of color blindness. First deuteranopia (red-green CB) , then monochromia (Full CB). I was not able to do a painting for Tritanopia (Blue- yellow CB) as I could not find a filter that both contained the condition as an option, allowed simulation rather than adjustment, as well as allowed real-time computer interaction.

*Figure 5. A screencapture of the 3 different colorwheels I worked from when creating the digital paintings on Krita. The first is the standard RGB colorwheel. The second is the same wheel adjusted for Deuteranopia. The last image is the standard wheel adjusted for Monochromia. All 3 colorwheels allow for adjustments in hue, saturation, and value.*

## Result and Future Work

[![4-comma][images-fig6]](https://example.com)

*Figure 6. A series of images showing the process of creating the Deuteranopia filter painting. The first row features the images in full color going from the initial block in stage, the smoothing stage, and finally the restructuring phase. The second row features the images with a Deuteranopia filter following the same previous 3 stages.*

I found that some characters were harder to recreate than others. It only took one prompt to generate the Incredible Hulk (see Figure 4.) but it took 14 prompts and re-wordings to get something poorly approximating Mickey Mouse before I gave up on the effort to generate the real deal. It seems that certain IPs are better protected than others. Whether due to repeated attempts by users to generate them or the litigiousness of the owners, one can only speculate. I would like to test the limits of this more with lesser-known properties in the future.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, Generative AI has a fundamental problem with plagiarism that will continue to cause issues despite the changes being attempted to fix it. This plagiarism is disrespectful to artists and unethical and will take a change in attitude and lots of work and money to fix.
