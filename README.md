  <p align="center">
    This project is a series of digital paintings exploring the ways in which color blindness can change the artistic method. Through the use of colorblind filters and digital software I created realistic portraits of copyright free photographs by trying to match the colors I saw with a colorblind filter on and the colors on an RGB digital colorwheel.

*Figure 1. My yonkoma comic. The story involves a girl growing into an artist starting from a young child observing the world to an accomplished adult artist. The comic then shows her creativity being wrung out of her by a corporation symbolized by the Mickey Mouse gloved hands. The comic is made with Acryllic paint and photocopied poorly into a digital medium except for the copyrighted AI generated images wrung out of the artist. There is a deliberate dichotomy between the traditional art and its muted color palette and differing panel sizes and the bright, oversaturated AI images that starkly contrast from the rest of the comic*

## Abstract
This project is an exploration of how different types of color blindness can effect the color choices an artist uses when attempting to accurately recreate a painting. I test the ways in which the color picking process changes when faced with the challenge of attempting to recreate realism with an added disability and the beautiful unintended results that can follow.

One of the largest ethical issues plaguing the new AI industry is the means by which many models acquired their training data [4]. The data is often scrapped from numerous sources across the internet without credit and used to train AI Image generation models. Those models then will often regurgitate those same stolen images in their outputs, sometimes without the user even knowing the generated image could be plagiarized and placing both the AI companies and their users at legal risk [2].

There have been recent efforts to make the generation methods of machine learning models more transparent through techniques such as Explainable AI (XAI) which could be a step towards solving these ethical issues [3]. But these efforts are likely to be ignored by large tech companies due to the effort and cost associated with ethically retraining such large models.

The greed inherent in decisions such as these, shirking ethics in lieu of profit and disregarding laws that  protect artists, inspired my yonkoma. The panels follow the growth of an artist from youth to the peak of their career. Their steady growth is abruptly halted in the 3rd cell as they are captured, and all the creativity is wrung out of them in the form of plagiarized AI images. 


## Methodology
[![4-comma][images-fig3]](https://example.com)

*Figure 3. A collection of the prompts (black text) and the images they generated in ChatGPT's DALLE-3 Image Generator. These images document the process to recreate the animated character Scooby Doo owned by Warner Brothers Entertainment despite OpenAI's copyright protections.*

I started this process by downloading the ColourSimulations app for windows as it allowed me to both simulate the sensation of color blindness on my screen without correcting the image through Daltonization [3] as well as interface with my computer normally (most other filter software is temporary and only shows a snapshot of a design in CB mode before reverting back to normal).

I then proceeded to attempt to recreate the source image as accurately as I could with the added handicap of the CB filter on. I started by sectioning the painting into smaller shapes and using the color picker to attempt to accurately simulate the hue, value, and saturation that I was seeing in the same section of the source image. The added difficulty of the CB handicap made this first pass much slower than I was used to as there were many more equivalent color choices to choose from. 

Once the painting was sectioned off into discrete color blocks I used a smoothing brush to obscure the section edges and add a smooth finish to the painting. Finally, I added a final restructuring layer that re-introduced areas of detail that were obscured by the smoothing pass.

I repeated this process for 2 different types of color blindness. First deuteranopia (red-green CB) , then monochromia (Full CB). I was not able to do a painting for Tritanopia (Blue- yellow CB) as I could not find a filter that both adjusted for it as well as allowed real-time computer interaction.

*Figure 4. A screencapture of the prompt to create the character of "The Hulk" owned by Marvel Entertainment and the image that it generated.*

## Result and Future Work
I found that some characters were harder to recreate than others. It only took one prompt to generate the Incredible Hulk (see Figure 4.) but it took 14 prompts and re-wordings to get something poorly approximating Mickey Mouse before I gave up on the effort to generate the real deal. It seems that certain IPs are better protected than others. Whether due to repeated attempts by users to generate them or the litigiousness of the owners, one can only speculate. I would like to test the limits of this more with lesser-known properties in the future.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, Generative AI has a fundamental problem with plagiarism that will continue to cause issues despite the changes being attempted to fix it. This plagiarism is disrespectful to artists and unethical and will take a change in attitude and lots of work and money to fix.
